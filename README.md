# WebDevelopment
Sample projects created during my learning journey. I have learnt and made these projects while doing the Responsive Web Design Certification offered by FreeCodeCamp. 

I learnt the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.
